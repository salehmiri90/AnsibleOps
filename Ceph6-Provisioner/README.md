# Deploying Ceph 6 with Automation Tools 
## Description
This repository will help you to do installation and configuration Ceph 6 on Redhat operating system version 8.  

## üé• Video Demo on Youtube

Instruction video is already uploaded to my youtube channel [salehmiri90](https://youtube.com/salehmiri90) and the video names are:

&#9745; In future will be published!

## Technologies and Tools
To implement this project, I only used Terraform and VMware vCenter product iso file. This method tested with vCenter 8.  

‚úÖ `Ansible`

‚úÖ `Ceph 6`

## Start to Use this code
### Step 1: Transfer codes to your Server
&#9745; To clone this repository from my GitHub using the command line, you can use the following command:
````
git clone https://github.com/salehmiri90/Automated_Ceph_Deployment.git
````

&#9745; Use the 'cd' command to get into the contents of the cloned directory 'Automated_Ceph_Deployment' and this project realted directory 'Automated_Ceph6' as follows: 
````
cd Automated_Ceph_Deployment/Automated_Ceph6
````

&#9745; And then listing the contents with the command: 
````
ll
````

### Step 2: Defining Variables
&#9745; Modify below files and set the correct variables based on your infrastracture and environment. Also you can configure general variables in 'group_vars/all.yml' file.
````
vim Automated_Ceph6/inventory/hosts
````

&#9745; Creat a copy from group variable templates file to a new file based on your group defination.
````
cp Automated_Ceph6/inventory/group_vars/template.yml Automated_Ceph6/inventory/group_vars/newgroup.yml
````
````
vim Automated_Ceph6/inventory/group_vars/newgroup.yml
````

&#9745; Creat a copy from host variable templates file to a new file based on your host defination.
````
cp Automated_Ceph6/inventory/host_vars/template.yml Automated_Ceph6/inventory/host_vars/newhost.yml
````
````
vim Automated_Ceph6/inventory/host_vars/newhost.yml
````

### Step 3: Execution
&#9745; Check ansible connectivity to targets. the name of server group is 'miri'.
```
ansible miri -m ping
```

&#9745; In case of using HPE physical servers, you have to poweroff all servers by running below command.
```
ansible-playbook 00.ilo_poweroff.yaml
```

&#9745; If you are using HPE physical servers, run below command to do one-click OS installation on target servers.
```
ansible-playbook 01.ilo_provision_rhel.yaml
```

&#9745; Doing post install and pre-configure ceph 6 cluster with below command. 
```
ansible-playbook 02.cluster_pre_config.yaml
```

&#9745; Configuring requirements only on 'MON' nodes.
```
ansible-playbook 03.mons_pre_config.yaml
```

&#9745; Configuring requirements only on 'OSD' nodes.
```
ansible-playbook 04.osds_pre_config.yaml
```

&#9745; In case of existing NVMe disks, run below command instead of abow playbook.
```
ansible-playbook 05.osds_pre_config_nvme.yaml
```

&#9745; Start bootstrapping Ceph6 cluster on only 'mon1' node using below playbook, because this configuration will done on only one server, you can do it by logging to this machine and run commands directly on the machine.
```
ansible-playbook 06.bootstrap_mon1.yaml
```

&#9745; Run below playbook on all of 'MON' nodes.
```
ansible-playbook 07.after_bootstrap.yaml
```

&#9745; Because of security vulnerabilities, you have to lock ansible users on target servers, running below playbook will adddress to do user lock on targets.
```
ansible-playbook 08.userlock.yaml
```
